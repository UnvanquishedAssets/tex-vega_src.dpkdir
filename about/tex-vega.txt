    Notes
    
	This is the texture set I made for the Unvanquished map 
	Vega Industries: Research Outpost 13. It is a complete overhaul
	of the texture set made for the Tremulous map. They were created
	from pictures and edited with the GIMP. Normal maps were generated
	in Blender and with the GIMP. Some work was done in Inkscape.

	Contact me if you're interested in the original high-res images.
	
	The Easter Eggs cartoon was made by Josky=KCT=.
