[_Vega Industries: Research Outpost 13_](https://github.com/UnvanquishedAssets/map-vega_src.dpkdir) is a game level featuring a futuristic research station for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project. This is the texture set originally designed for this map.

This texture set is a work in progress by Stijn “Ingar” Buys for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

This texture set is meant to be used with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).
